# C# Web Development

## Course Summary

This course is an introduction to **C#** and the .NET framework. C# is a programming language developed by Microsoft and used in almost all of its products.

This course is designed for learners who are already familiar with at least one programming language. Thus, we’ll move quickly through the syntax rules and procedural basics of the language (ie, how does one write a `for` loop in C#? a conditional statement? Etc.).

As you’ve likely heard before, once you grasp the fundamentals of programming in one language, learning another becomes much easier. Professional software developers often work in environments involving several programming languages so it’s wise to start learning new ones early on in your career.

Beyond the basics of programming in C#, you’ll learn some key object oriented concepts to enhance the capabilities of your programs. You’ll also download a program called **Visual Studio IDE** to get familiar with the tools of the C# developer. In the final lessons of this course, you will use a C# framework called **ASP.NET Core MVC**. This framework gives us the scaffolding necessary to create MVC programs (another concept we’ll cover) effectively and efficiently.

## Where this Course Leads

Upon completion of the content within this course you will be capable of building a web application with ASP.NET Core MVC that can store data in a local database. You will also be ready to start reviewing the Liftoff materials, which focus on career-readiness and building a personal project.

While you are entering a new career in technology, we hope you use the tools you learned in this program to learn new skills.
You may find yourself wanting to learn more about the cloud, advanced testing tools, or building bigger and better APIs.
Whatever it is, now that you have conquered the foundations of computer programming, we know you are ready for the challenge!
