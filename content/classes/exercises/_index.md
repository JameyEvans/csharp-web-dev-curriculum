Before you get started, make sure you have forked and cloned the [starter code](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/csharp-web-dev-exercises) repository for the exercises.
We will be focusing on the project named `Classes`.

1. Open up the file, `Student.cs`, and update the starter code to make use of auto-implemented properties.

1. In `Program.cs`, instantiate the `Student` class using yourself as the student. For the
   `NumberOfCredits` give yourself `1` for this class and a GPA of `4.0`
   because you are a C# superstar!

   Test your  new `Student` object with print statements.  Are you able to get and set each field?

1. In the `Classes` project, create a class `Course` with at least three
   fields. Before diving into Visual Studio, try using pen and paper to work through
   what these might be. At least one of your fields should be a `List`
   or `Dictionary`, and you should use your `Student` class.

1. Using auto-implemented properties, in the `SchoolPractice` project, create a class `Teacher` with four properties:
   `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Subject`, and `YearsTeaching`.
