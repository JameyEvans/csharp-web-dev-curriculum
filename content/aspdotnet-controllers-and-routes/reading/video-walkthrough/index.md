This is a video walkthrough of all the steps taken during the chapter. To follow along, make sure to fork and clone [HelloASPDotNET](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/HelloASPDotNET). The video starts on the `main` branch and ends on the `controllers-and-routing` branch. The video includes timestamps that correspond to each page in the reading in case you want to revisit a specific task or technique.
