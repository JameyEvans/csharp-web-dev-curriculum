## Next Steps

Now that you have successfuly scaffolding Identity into an existing project and impleneted authentication you can further explore the topics below:

1. For further review you can visit [Introduction to Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio)
2. Visit the following documentation for information on [Identity model customization in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/customize-identity-model?view=aspnetcore-6.0) 
3. [Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/). Microsoft Identity Platform allows users of your application to sign in using their Microsoft Identities or social accounts. Several components that allow this to work are [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID](https://auth0.com/).
