## Installation Steps

### Prerequisites

Before you start installing anything, you should first make sure that you can install this on your computer.

### Install Visual Studio

Walk through the installation process by following Microsoft’s [Install Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2022) guide.

Here are some things you should keep in mind as you install Visual Studio:

## A Tour of Your New IDE

Microsoft has created a [walkthrough](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/quickstart-ide-orientation?view=vs-2022) of the Visual Studio 2022. We recommend you read through this to learn the location of key components within your new IDE.

## Troubleshooting Your Install

If you need to troubleshoot your install, first check out the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/troubleshooting-installation-issues?view=vs-2022). If this does not help, check out the below sections and consult your TA if something is still off.

### Missing or Wrong Components?

If you realize (or worry) that you did not install Visual Studio correctly, the [Modify Visual Studio Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/modify-visual-studio?view=vs-2022) can help you make any needed modifications. This includes changing your workloads or individual components.

### Already have Visual Studio on Your Computer?

If you don’t have this most recent version of Visual Studio installed, you will need to updated it. The [Update Visual Studio Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/update-visual-studio?view=vs-2022) can help you update your old version of VS to the latest. At the time of this writing, the current version for the course is 2022.

Updating can also help you keep any of your workloads, extensions, or other installed packages up to date.
