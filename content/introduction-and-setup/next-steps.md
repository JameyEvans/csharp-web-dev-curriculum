## Next Steps

Now that you have Visual Studio set up, you are ready to start programming in C#. Before you dive in, make sure to bookmark Microsoft's [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) for C#. Microsoft regularly updates the documentation to address common errors or to make sure you, as a developer, get the latest info after a new release. The next chapter is on how data types and variables work in C#. Before you start reading up on the next topic, here are a couple extensions you might enjoy experimenting with in Visual Studio:

1. [Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EWoodruff.VisualStudioSpellChecker)
1. [Visual Studio Theme Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=idex.vsthemepack)
1. [Developer News](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.DeveloperNews2022)

If you are struggling with your new install of Visual Studio, don't hesitate to reach out to course staff for assistance so you can code along with the examples in the next chapter.
