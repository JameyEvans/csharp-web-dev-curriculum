For this studio, you will design and build a console program that allows the user to take a quiz. This means you will have to create some questions and get some input from the user.

First, the questions. We want to be able to handle multiple types of questions:

   1. **Multiple choice:** A question with a fixed set of possible answers. A user can only select one answer and only one answer is correct.

   1. **Checkbox:** A question with a fixed set of possible answers. A user can select any number of answers and there is one correct combination of choices.

   1. **True/False:** A question that has a true/false answer.

## Design

In order to design your program, consider:

   1. What do these types of questions have in common?
   1. What makes these question types different?

First, design a base class (called `Question`) that contains the common features, and design subclasses for each of the question types. For each question type be sure to include:

   1. Class name
   1. Fields and properties with access modifiers
   1. Methods with access modifiers
   1. Any inheritance relationship

Should any of the classes be `abstract`? If so, should any of its methods be `abstract`?

Make sure that there is functionality included to display the questions, to display the possible answers, and to check to see if the answer(s) is correct.

Then design the `Quiz` class. A quiz has a list of questions, and we should be able to:
   
   1. Add questions
   1. Run or carry out the quiz
   1. Grade the quiz

## Implementation

Create a new Visual Studio console project and implement the design that you created. If you are unsure about your design, get some feedback by talking through it with a classmate before you start coding.

## Putting It All Together

In `Program.cs`, the project should create several questions, present them to the user, accept the userâ€™s responses, and then tell them whether their answers were correct or incorrect.

## Commit Your Work

Push up your work to a new Github repository.

## Bonus Missions

1. Add a short answer question type that includes validation behavior to only allow the user to enter text with less than 80 characters.

1. Add a couple of more question types to your program:

   1. Linear scale: a question that allows the user to provide a numeric response within an integer scale, which may vary from question to question. For instance, it could be 1-3 for one linear scale question, and 1-5 for another.

   1. Paragraph: Similar to a short answer, allows for responses of up to 500 characters.

1. Test your non-abstract classes with a new MSTest project.
