For this studio, you will design and build a console program that allows the user to take a quiz. This means you will have to create some questions and get some input from the user.

First, the questions. We want to be able to handle multiple types of questions:

   1. **Multiple choice:** A question with a fixed set of possible answers. A user can only select one answer and only one answer is correct.

   1. **Checkbox:** A question with a fixed set of possible answers. A user can select any number of answers and there is one correct combination of choices.

   1. **True/False:** A question that has a true/false answer.
