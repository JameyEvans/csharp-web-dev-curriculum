Letâ€™s examine an inheritance relationship between two classes: `Cat` and `HouseCat`. `HouseCat` is a class that inherits from Cat, so `HouseCat` receives the data and behaviors of Cat. These inherited traits are things like fields, properties, and methods. Any fields and non-constructor methods in Cat are available to each instance of `HouseCat`.

When we speak about an inheritance relationship, we say that a `HouseCat` is a `Cat`, or **extends** `Cat`. In order to define a class that inherits from another, we use the : syntax.
