## Introduction

Congratulations! Based on your hard work and strong coding skills, you have
been brought on as an apprentice to the LaunchCode Tech Team. You will be
paired with a mentor to help you get comfortable and continue learning.

The Company Team at LaunchCode works with employer partners to match qualified
programmers with apprenticeships. They asked for a new tool to be built to
help them easily manage data for currently available jobs. Over the next few
weeks, you will help them build this application alongside mentors from the
Tech Team.

This first project will be a simple prototype. A prototype in software development is a basic working version of a proposed product. Software developers build prototypes to get feedback on proposed features and adjust the project timeline, as needed. This prototype won't be pretty or have lots of features, but it will give you a chance to work through
some initial concepts and get feedback from LaunchCode staff.

Your mentor on this project is Blake.

### Learning Objectives

In this project, you will show that you can:

1. Read and understand code written by others.
1. Use core C# syntax (methods, variables, loops, conditionals).
1. Utilize `List` and `Dictionary` collection types.
1. Work with console I/O via the `Console` class.
1. Work with data types and arrays.

## TechJobs (Console Edition)

The app you must help design is a simple console (i.e. command-line) prototype
of the new TechJobs app. It will allow LaunchCode staff to browse and search
listings of open jobs by employer partners.

The prototype process gives everybody a chance to work out some initial ideas
without investing a ton of time into developing a finished product. Once
everybody likes the prototype, the Tech Team will begin work toward a
full-fledged application.

### Your Assignment

Blake created a console application and started to fill in some features. His
code allows users to search job listings by one of several fields. It can also
display lists of all of the values of a given field in the system (e.g. all
employers, or all locations).

Blake has now handed the task off to you. You must add a couple of features and
then get feedback from the Company Team.

## Getting Started

<!-- TODO: Add link back to Assignment 0 -->

In Canvas, **Graded Assignment #1: TechJobs Console** contains a GitHub Classroom assignment invitation link and then set up the project in Visual Studio. Refer back to the GitHub Classroom instructions from Assignment 0 for details. 

## Your Tasks

<!-- TODO: Add reference back to Assignment 0 -->

Before diving into your tasks, review Assignment 0 for details on running autograding tests in C#. This assignment has multiple tests, and we recommend the following workflow:

1. Write the code for the task, verify manually that your code works by running the `TechJobsConsoleAutograded` project.
1. When you think you've completed a task, run the individual test that corresponds to the task. 
1. If the test fails, review the test output and go back to your code to fix the bug.
1. Once the single test passes, run *all* of the tests to make sure you didn't break any tests that previously passed.
1. Repeat this process until all tests pass. 

Now we'll outline the tasks for your first apprenticeship assignment.
