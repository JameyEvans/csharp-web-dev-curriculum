# Assignment #2: Tech Jobs (Object-Oriented Edition)

## Introduction
Your apprenticeship at LaunchCode is going well! Only a few weeks in and you’re regularly making contributions to code that will eventually be used by all LaunchCode staff.

Your last task was to get the prototype Tech Jobs app in good shape. Now it’s time to advance the underlying structure of the program.

Your mentor on this project is Sally, one of the developers at LaunchCode. She regularly supports coders who are just getting started with their careers.

<!-- TODO: Insert Image Here -->

After seeing your strong work with your last project, Blake reported that you performed well and learned quickly. Because of your success, he and Sally feel comfortable assigning you to a set of tasks that are a notch up in difficulty.

Sally completed some initial work on the project and left you some `TODO`s.
