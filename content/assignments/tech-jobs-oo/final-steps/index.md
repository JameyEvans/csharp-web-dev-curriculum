## Sanity Check

Once you finish all of the tasks outlined above, all that remains is to check the console display.

Sally has provided some commented-out code in `RunTechJobs.cs` that prints out a small list of `Job` objects. Go ahead and activate this code and run it. Properly done, your output should look something like the following:

   ```csharp

   ID: 1
   Name: Product tester
   Employer: ACME
   Location: Desert
   Position Type: Quality control
   Core Competency: Persistence


   ID: 2
   Name: Web Developer
   Employer: LaunchCode
   Location: St. Louis
   Position Type: Front-end developer
   Core Competency: JavaScript


   ID: 3
   Name: Ice cream tester
   Employer: Data not available
   Location: Home
   Position Type: UX
   Core Competency: Tasting ability

   ```
Excellent! You successfully shifted the old console app into a more useful object-oriented configuration.

Now that the new structure is ready, another team member can refactor the import and display methods from the previous assignment to use the new classes. Once these are ready, our team will refine the search features and move the app online to provide a better user interface.

## How to Submit

1. Stage, Commit, and Push to GitHub Classroom.

1. Verify the results of your submission.  Continue to work on your code until you pass all of the tests.

## Congrats!
