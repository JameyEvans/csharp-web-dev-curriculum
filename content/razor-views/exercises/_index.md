In this chapter, we started working on an application for tracking various coding events around town.

## Getting Started
Open up your `CodingEvents` project in Visual Studio. Create and checkout a new branch to complete these exercises.

TODO: Link to branch
The code you start with should roughly resemble [this branch](LINK). If you have been coding along with the video lessons, you’re probably in good shape.

As always, give the branch a useful name, like `view-exercises`.

Now, let’s add descriptions to our events.

## Expanding our Events Schedule
