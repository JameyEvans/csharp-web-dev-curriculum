Welcome to the Walkthrough for creating and using templates in your `CodingEvents` project.

- Creating an `EventsController` that contains `Index`, `Add`, and `NewEvent` action methods
- Creating an `Events` View directory that has `Index` and `Add` views.
- Using `Redirect` to return a user to a view that contains an updated list of events.
- Using [anchor tags](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/built-in/anchor-tag-helper?view=aspnetcore-6.0)
