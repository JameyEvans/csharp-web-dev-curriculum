After all of the hard work we have put into learning about Razor templates, it is time for a spa day. Let’s make an application to select some spa services.

Our application needs to do the following:

   1. Display the user’s name and skin type under their customer profile.
   1. Display the appropriate facial treatments for their skin type.
   1. Display the description of the spa’s manicures or pedicures depending on the user’s interest.

As always, read through the whole page before starting to code.
