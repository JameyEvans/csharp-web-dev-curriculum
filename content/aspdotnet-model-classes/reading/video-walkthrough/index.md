This is a video walkthrough of all the steps taken during the chapter. To follow along, make sure to fork and clone [CodingEvents](https://github.com/launchcodeeducation/codingevents). The video starts on the `models-start` branch and ends on the `models` branch. The video includes timestamps that correspond to each page in the reading in case you want to revisit a specific task or technique.

   If you completed the exercises from the chapter on Views, then your version of CodingEvents will look a lot like the `models-start` branch. Some of the elements from the exercises will help you out with making your version of CodingEvents the best it can be!
