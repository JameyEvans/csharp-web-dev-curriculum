You will find the starter code for the exercises in the [csharp-web-dev-exercises](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/csharp-web-dev-exercises) repo in the `Exceptions` project.

## Divide By Zero!

The professor you TA for, Professor Jackson, shared with you the code she uses to auto-grade studentsâ€™ work. She and the other TAs have encountered some problems with the code in the past when they enter the total possible point value for an assignment. Occasionally, they accidentally enter `0` for the total number of possible points and the program encounters a fatal error when trying to divide by 0.

To help out with this issue, complete a function called `Divide()` in `Program.cs`.

   - The `Divide()` method takes in two parameters: `x` and `y`.
   - Your function should return the result of x/y.
   - However, if y is zero, you should throw an exception, such as `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`.

```csharp
   static double Divide(double x, double y)
   {
      if (y == 0.0)
      {
         throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("y", "You cannot divide by zero!");
      }
      else
      {
         return x / y;
      }
   }
```
